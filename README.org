#+KEYWORDS: string, buffer, dynamic string, lex, yacc

* Introduction

  This is a dynamic string buffer library for C.  It was originally
  developed at Musician's Friend in 2000-2002, and was released open
  source in March of 2005.  I believe that the intent was to release
  it under the GNU license, though at the time I never got around to
  updating the licensing information.

* Building

  It may be a bit out-of-date, but it should build using the standard
  autoconf toolset.

* Documentation

  The documentation is in TeXinfo format.  It's thorough and it's
  located in the doc/ directory.

* Questions, etc.

  Please contact me at pymander<at>gmail.com with any questions.
  Thanks for checking this little library out!
